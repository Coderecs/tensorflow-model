## Parameter tuning

1. epochs = 20, hiddenDim= 100, learning rate = 0.001, batchSize = 100  -> Not very satisfactory result

2. epochs=20, hiddenDim=500, learningRate=0.01, batchSize=100 -> Not very satisfactory

3. epochs=20, hiddenDim=1000, learningRate=0.01, batchSize=500 -> Some better results I see

4. epochs=20, hiddenDim=1000, learningRate=0.01, batchSize=5000 -> too much computationally expensive (itne resources nai h :crycatok::sed:)

5. epochs=20, hiddenDim=1000, learningRate=0.01, batchSize=1000 -> Nothing much changed from the last one

6. epochs=20, hiddenDim=3000, learningRate=0.01, batchSize=1000 -> Same as before

7. epochs=50, hiddenDim=5000, learningRate=0.1, batchSize=1000 -> Same as before

8. epochs=10, hiddenDim=5000, learningRate=0.1, batchSize=1000 -> Same as before
